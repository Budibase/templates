# Budibase Templates

To add a template
- export your app
- add a new folder under the app directory in the repo
- it has a definition.json, which includes its name, icon etc. You can just copy and paste one of the other ones
- you then need to add your export file under db/dump.txt
- merge to master, and it will automatically get picked up by BB
